## Australia

    -   allegedly (LaTeX Lovers, 2025)
-   They have elections
    -   Next ones must be held before May 2025
-   Can you vote in them?
    -   Who knows...
-   How should you make your electoral decision?

. . .

**Trust your gut**

## Trust your gut

Gut-brain axis

-   gut-microbiome affects brain chemistry, possible cognition
-   has traditionally been ignored in research on decision-making
-   may actually be involved in important decisions such as voting

. . . 

**does one use their gut to make electoral decisions?**

## *"Ask not what your country can do for you,*\n but what you can doo-doo for your country" - JFK

Scenario sketch:

-   You want to vote in the 2025 Australian election
-   But you have not made up your gut yet
-   So you find a public restroom
-   Let your gut decide
-   Go vote.

. . . 

**how would you vote?**

## What are the voting patterns related to public toilets in Australia?
